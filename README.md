A Machine Learning Regressor Modeling application

This application was built for the purpose of deepening my understanding of the process required to build a machine learning regressor model. This required learning the importance of outliers to multicollinearity to encoding techniques and much more. This application of course does not cover the process of building a model in its entirety, but it definitely covers some major aspects of it. This project was originally created in the form of an application because I personally wanted the opportunity to play with a models' parameters to see how it changes the model, without individually coding each scenario and rerunning the script. Also creating the project in an application form makes it a more fun and interactive experience for those I share it with, including family and friends who have no clue about ML! 

I hope you enjoy, thanks for checking it out!
